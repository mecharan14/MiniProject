          <p class="lead my-3">There are more than 100 school farms now running in the India and, according to the School Farms Network, 100 more are in the pipeline. McMillan claims the farm can be used to teach any subject, whether it's crop rotation in geography, history of agriculture or geometry in maths. The practical element which the farm injects into lessons has resulted in students who have typically struggled academically engaging significantly more and flourishing in the classroom.&hellip;</p><hr class="my-4">

          <p class="lead my-3">Farm-to-school programs encourage schools to buy farm-fresh foods from their local community to serve in the cafeteria and feature educational activities in the classroom. Students gain access to healthy, nutritious food as well as educational opportunities such as farm field trips, garden-based learning, cooking lessons, and recycling programs. The farm-to-school approach helps children and families understand where their food comes from and how their food choices can impact their health, the environment, and their community.</p><hr>

          <p class="lead my-3">Modern farming technology is used to improve the wide types of production practices employed by farmers. It makes use of hybrid seeds of selected variety of a single crop, technologically advanced equipment and lots of energy subsidies in the form of irrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides.</p><hr>

          <p class="lead my-3">The use of drones in almost every sector of the economy is growing fast, but drone usage in the agricultural industry is booming. According to some reports, the agricultural drone market is expected to grow from a $1.2 billion(USD) industry in 2019 to $4.8 billion in 2024. From scouting to security, drone use will become more ubiquitous on large and small scale farms in a few short years. The information gathered by drones on farms is often used to better inform agronomic decisions and is part of a system generally referred to as <b>precision agriculture</b>.

In many areas, drone use has become an essential part of large scale precision farming operations already. The data collected from drones recording fields help farmers plan their planting and treatments to achieve the best possible yields. Some reports indicate that using precision farming systems can increase yields by as much as 5%, which is a sizeable increase in an industry with typically slim profit margins.</p>

            Drone use to apply spray treatments is already widespread in south-east Asia, with South Korea using drones for approximately 30% of their agriculture spraying. Drone sprayers are able to navigate very hard to reach areas, such as steep tea fields at high elevations.  &hellip;

            Some of the newer uses for drone use in agriculture are still in testing and development. One of the most publicized (and often fictionalized) uses is pollinating drone technology. &hellip;

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
            New research out of Australia is also creating exciting opportunities for drone use in agriculture. As climate change increasingly affects drought conditions, creating more efficient irrigation solutions is vital. Using microwave sensing, drones are able to capture very accurate soil health information including moisture levels without the plants getting in the way. &hellip;
